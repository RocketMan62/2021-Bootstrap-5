        <h3>Bee Movie Recap</h3></br>The Bee Movie is the story of a young bee named Barry Bee Benson and his adventures as he explores the Human world. After meeting and talking to a women named Vanessa who works at a flower store Barry returns to
        Vanessa's house several times. Andy, Vanessa's boyfreind does not like Barry. So Andy attcks Barry when he is over for dinner one day and they have a fight until Vanessa breaks up the fight and breaks up with Andy. A bit later Barry finds
        out while shopping at the Grocery store with Vanessa that his people are basically slaves kept for making honey. As a result of this he sues the honey corperations with the assistance of Vanessa and eventually the rest of his hive for
        stealing his peoples honey. After winning the court case against the honey corperations, The honey is returned to the bees causing the production of honey to cease and after a while all the plants in the ecosystem begin to die due to the
        lack of distrubution of pollen because the bees are no longer working due to the excess of honey. Eventually Barry realsises why the world needs bees and the importance of a Bees work. So he reunites with Vanessa after she almost left and
        together they get the last of the flowers to the bees by hijacking a plane so that way they can take the pollen of those flowers and save the ecosystem. The movie ends with Barry working at a law firm where he helps animals sue humans.
        Note: We never know wether or not Vanessa likes jazz.
